### ♻️ AI-Powered Smart Waste Bin

The **AI-Powered Smart Waste Bin** is an intelligent, touch-free waste disposal system designed for the future of smart homes and cities. Using proximity sensors and real-time AI vision, the bin detects when a user approaches and automatically opens its lid — no contact needed.

Once waste is deposited, advanced image recognition models analyze and classify the item, directing it into the correct compartment: **biodegradable** or **non-biodegradable**. The bin continuously monitors its fill level and alerts users when full, ensuring seamless operation and smarter waste management.

No buttons. No confusion. Just smarter, cleaner living.
